# Ghost Evader

## A Simple Game for a Unity Beginner Level Tutorial

The game starts with a player locked in a room and must collect coins and stay alive as long as possible.

## Enemies

Enemy ghosts patrol the room when spawned. Initially they head in the direction of the player. After N seconds if they have not hit the player then they change directions to wherever the player is. If the ghost goes offscreen then it is destroyed to keep the number of enemies down.

## Scoring

As the player picks up coins it is added to the players score

## Player Health

Player starts with 3 lives. Any contact with a ghost kills the player and the round is over. If the player loses all of their lives the game will end.

## Balancing

After a set number of points the level becomes faster.
